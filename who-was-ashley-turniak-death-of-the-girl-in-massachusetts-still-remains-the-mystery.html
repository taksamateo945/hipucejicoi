Death Of The Girl In Massachusetts Still Remains The Mystery</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Ashley Turniak’s death has been a mystery for almost 25 years, and her mother still wants to know what happened to her beloved daughter on that day.</strong></p><p>Turniak was a junior at Agawam High School. He was born in Feeding Hills, Hampden County, Massachusetts, on May 17, 1982. He was 16 years old at the time.</p><p>But on November 9, 1998, in Longmeadow, Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States, she knocked on heaven’s door with a dream to become a nurse.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36010 alt="Ashley Turniak" width=700 height=415 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ashley-Turniak-700x415.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36010 class=wp-caption-text>Ashley Turniak</p><h2 id=why-did-jake-mclean-and-lauren-goodger-split>Why Did Jake McLean And Lauren Goodger Split?</h2><p>Ashley Turniak, a 16-year-old high school student, died in a terrible accident on November 9, 1998. Her death is still a mystery, and retired State Police Sgt. Alan Joubert still has nightmares about the case.</p><p>Even after 24 years, no one knows who killed Ashley, and the person who is thought to have pushed her out of the window of a fast-moving car has never been caught.</p><p>Even if she jumped out of the window herself, it’s not clear if the driver pushed her from the south on Interstate 91 in Longmeadow or if she did it herself. Also, the investigators haven’t told the media anything about what they’re looking into.</p><p>Turniak was a nice and pretty young girl who was liked by everyone who met her. She wanted to be a nurse when she grew up. But someone stole both her dreams and her life, and the case stayed open. So, don’t be afraid to call the State Police Detective Unit at (413) 505–5993 if you have any information about her case.</p><h2 id=the-murder-of-ashley-turniak-and-mysterious-scenes-explained>The Murder Of Ashley Turniak And Mysterious Scenes Explained</h2><p>Turniak, a junior at Agawam High School, died in Longmeadow, Hampden County, Massachusetts, USA, in 1998 as she was leaving school without going to class.</p><p>The victim had plans with a friend, so she was waiting outside the school for her. Her friend was late, and when the victim got there, she couldn’t find her anywhere.</p><p>Later, someone saw the high school student go feet-first through the passenger side window of a speeding car. Ashley survived the initial impact, but she died soon after at the scene.</p><p>Call your local police department or the State Police Detective Unit at 413-505-5941 or the State Police Unresolved Cases Unit at 1-855-MA-SOLVE if you know anything about the unsolved murder cases.</p><p>Also, the witness said the car was tan or dark blue, but the police said it was a tan or light brown midsize car from the late 1980s. It could have been a Ford Tempo.</p><p>Another woman said that the driver was a man with olive skin who wouldn’t come forward because she was afraid for her safety. Her backpack was found in front of a house on a short dead-end street in Enfield, a few blocks from Exit 49 on Woodlawn Avenue.</p><p>But because the police didn’t know how long the backpack had been there, they didn’t share the information they found during their investigations. Also, her mom said she would never get in someone’s car without knowing them, so it’s possible she knew the driver. So, the murder case hasn’t been solved to this day.</p><h2 id=where-are-ashley-turniaks-parents-nownbsp>Where Are Ashley Turniak’s Parents Now?</h2><p>Ashley’s parents may live with memories of her always in their minds. They must have had a hard time moving on with their lives after losing a child so young.</p><p>She lived with her beloved mother, Annette Turniak, at the Pheasant Hill Village condo complex in the Feeding Hills area. No information is known about her father. We also don’t know if she had other siblings or was an only child.</p><p>Also, Annette might have given birth to another beautiful soul after her loss, or she might have adopted kids to keep herself company. She hasn’t been seen in public or used social networking sites since that day, but she still wants to know what happened. We hope they are doing well, and we wish them happiness in their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5ikerit0maYrKCcmsZuwNSrpaKZm2Kxpq3ToWSonl2ptaZ5xqKppWWZo3qurdKsmJygpaiytcDSZqqtoZyherOxzJqgp6tdqbWmecyyqq2doq58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
