Some even compared Zendaya to an actual princess.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2wmrODgusb/</p><p>She was earlier presented with the Fashion Force Award, and it looks like she is doing a good job living up to the expectations set by this recognition.</p><p>Zendaya also opened up about her fashion tastes, explaining that it was something very emotional and personal to her, and has allowed her to show a more careless attitude to the world, without worrying so much about people’s opinions and other similar issues.</p><p>Unfortunately, Zendaya did not get nominated for any Emmy Awards, although she is reportedly feeling hopeful for next year.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2xBuV7AfeD/</p><p>Whether her dreams will come true is early to tell, but she clearly has a strong following among her fans, so it would be interesting to see if they manage to push things in the right direction.</p><p>Zendaya certainly would not mind all the extra attention anyway, and she has made it clear that she is proud of where she is on the public stage at the moment.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2X9W7HAXey/</p><p>Zendaya might have a reason for dressing like Poisson Ivy. After Rihanna denied that she wanted the role of the famous comic book character, Zendaya confirmed she would love the gig. RiRi would probably be supportive if Zendaya does get the part.</p><p>Zendaya told Entertainment Tonight of the award show: “You know what, they didn’t call me yet. But if they did, I would love to go in and try out because Poison Ivy is one of my obsessions in life. I did it for Halloween one year, I mean come on!”</p><p>One fan had this to say: “Zendaya you Won the night with this one. Damn. 👀 God is real. 🖤 She made you in Her image. 🤷🏽‍♂️🔥💯 I’ ve commented on every one of your posts this morning and I keep asking myself if I’m overdoing it, but Nah, you killed this lol you deserve all the gas.”</p><p>Another commenter shared: “I feel like a damn stalker commenting on every post of this look 😩 , but you really DID that!! Whew!”</p><p>A third person revealed: “I’m tempted to go on and on about how you’ve given us visibility and opportunity by disrupting industry standards and being unapologetic about your vision, but ima just cut it short and say THANK YOU! 🖤🙏🏾”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Zendaye has had a banner year thanks to series, Euphoria.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeqmrulrdiaZKudppqurb%2BMrZ%2BeZaKarrS7zWadqKpdnbKzecSmnKuZnJl6qL7EnqVmnKKawLR50aKfmqaelnqutcahq2akmaCybrTEq2Spp6OotqO4xGalnrCkYrqwwsRmamtsYmqDcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
