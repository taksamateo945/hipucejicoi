Obviously, it sucks the preconceived notions of, you know, the new quarterback coming in and he has all of this stuff on his Twitter. I just hope that they're open to me and once they get to know me they're going to like me because I'm going to be doing everything I can to help the team win."</p><p>The 21-year-old quarterback made it clear that he has grown up in the years since those tweets, via NFL Network's James Palmer:</p>James Palmer <span class=acct>@JamesPalmerTV</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here are the quotes from Josh Allen on red carpet. "I was a kid. I’m not the same person I was. Obviously we were young and dumb and me and my friends, and that’s what we did. We made mistakes; I own up to it." https://t.co/WIX1dJmmzS</p><p>On Thursday morning, Stephen A. Smith revealed on ESPN's&nbsp;First Take&nbsp;that he had talked to Allen overnight. It was then that the potential first-round pick said that a number of the controversial posts were pop culture references. ESPN posted video of Smith's report:</p><p>Wyoming football coach Craig Bohl also used the red carpet to defend his player, via&nbsp;USA Today Sports:</p>USA TODAY Sports <span class=acct>@usatodaysports</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wyoming football coach Craig Bohl defends Josh Allen: "He knows who he is, and as he continues to move forward, he's not going to forget those roots." https://t.co/rRCpD9BBHG</p><p>As Allen took responsibility for the tweets, many wondered how his draft stock would be affected. ESPN's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Schefter</a>&nbsp;noted on Thursday that one theory that has been thrown out there is that a team put the tweets in the spotlight in hopes of scaring others from selecting him, increasing the odds he would fall to it.</p><p>The former Wyoming star has been rumored to go as high as No. 1 overall to the Cleveland Browns and is viewed as a lock for the first round.&nbsp;Bleacher Report's<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=#>Matt Miller</a><span>&nbsp;</span>has Allen as the second-ranked quarterback and the No. 7 overall prospect in his final big board.</p><p>Teams will have to decide if Allen can help their organization win football games. He may wind up having to wait longer than expected to hear&nbsp;his name called as a result of this situation, though. And regardless of what he says to the cameras, he will have a locker room full of teammates to explain himself to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBvYmyGd3nJqKqhZZGhuaa6jJqnqKSfnLa7sdJmmKCZmaN6p7vRZqmam5mowW7A1p6cratdnbyxsdJmq56ZnaKutbHSZpuopqRit7awxp5koaGd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
