"Every college athlete I know is obsessed with Livvy as well. It was a no-brainer for us."</p><p>Dunne has the third-highest NIL valuation at On3 (<a href=# rel=noopener>$3.7 million</a>), which trails only Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders and USC guard Bronny James. Thanks to her 13.2 million followers across multiple social media platforms, the 21-year-old has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the NIL era.</p><p>On3 lists Nautica, Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions, Body Armour, Grubhub and American Eagle among her <a href=# rel=noopener>endorsements</a>.</p><p>Signing an NIL deal with Passes would seemingly point toward Dunne's return or at least the continuation of her college career. The New Jersey native was a senior on the Tigers' national championship-winning squad but has an additional year of eligibility that was granted amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Should Dunne decide to explore avenues outside LSU, her massive popularity would likely open doors at a lot of other schools.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW6BdX6Mpaquq12htrfC2Gabrqaemnqis9GenKxlpKR6rsHLraCmoZyhtrC6jJ2mpaSRp3qvtctmmqimpKeupMCMsKCtoF2lrrS%2FxKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
