She didn’t move her foot till she could cover it with her large black purse. Unfortunately, the paparazzi were filming her every step. Then, in August 2013, the retail company H&M fired her because they have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs. Delevingne was the model for H&M’s Divided collection.</p><p>In July 2022, she appeared on The Tonight Show, hosted by Jimmy Fallon.
