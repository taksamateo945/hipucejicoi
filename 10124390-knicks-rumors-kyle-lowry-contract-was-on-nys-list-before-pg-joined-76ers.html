"I told him, 'Pull up.' Told him, 'F--k with us.' But, obviously, that didn't happen, so f--k him."</p><p>The Miami Heat traded Lowry to the Hornets on Jan. 23 as part of the deal that sent Terry Rozier to South Florida.</p><p>Lowry did not play a game in Charlotte before he agreed to a buyout and was waived by the Hornets on Jan. 11. He inked a one-year contract with the Sixers two days later.</p><p>Lowry, who turned 38 in March, has played 18 NBA seasons for teams including the Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies, Heat and 76ers.</p><p>That list very nearly included the Knicks, who came close to agreeing with the Raptors on a trade that would have sent Lowry to New York in 2013, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Vaccaro</a> of the <i>New York Post.</i></p><p>Instead, Lowry remained in Toronto, where he helped the Raptors win the franchise's first NBA title in 2019.</p><p>Lowry may no longer be the All-Star-caliber player he was with the Raptors, having averaged 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists in 23 appearances with the Sixers following his midseason signing.</p><p>But Lowry recently showed the Knicks what he is capable of when he put up 18 points in Game 1 of Philadelphia's first-round series against New York. That performance could help encourage Knicks leadership to continue their pursuit of the veteran guard this summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmAenyMpKWim5uoerPBzKiprGWbrrmmecuorquxXZi8r8DRmpqtZaeWwG67zWalsqtdoba0wIybnJ%2Bnopp6sbOMo6aippWZeniCxKuq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
