He has also been outstanding for Nigeria’s Under-20, Under-23, or senior team, where he holds the record for being the first Nigerian to score more than once in a FIFA World Cup match and the first Nigerian to score in two FIFA World Cup competitions.</p><p>Ahmed Musa’s exploits as a football player have largely contributed to his net worth, and he is currently among the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>richest Nigerian football stars</a>. With such massive net worth, Ahmed Musa has invested in several businesses, and it affords him a luxury lifestyle that many can only dream about.</p><p>Not one to not care about others, Musa has also used his wealth to alleviate poverty in Nigeria. He has, along the line, gained the nickname of the governor from his teammates as it is widely believed that when he is done with his career, he will be joining politics.</p><h2><strong>Breakdown Of The Salaries He Has Earned Throughout His Career</strong></h2><p>Ahmed Musa began his career in Nigeria. His journey to success as a footballer was kickstarted at GBS Football Academy in 2008. That same year, he was loaned out to JUTH Football Club, where he caught the attention of scouts all over the country by scoring four goals in eighteen games for the team. It was only a matter of time before big teams came knocking for the striker, and as expected, he agreed to join Kano Pillars on loan in 2009.</p><p>The young professional went on to set the Nigerian Premier League on fire that season, scoring 18 goals in 25 games to set the record for the highest goals ever scored in one season. While figures of what he earned at this time are not available, it is believed that he was hugely compensated for his achievements.</p><h3><strong>He Joined Dutch Team VVV-Venlo After His Record-Setting Season</strong></h3><p>In 2010, Ahmed Musa got his dream move to Europe when Dutch club VVV-Venlo signed him for an undisclosed fee. It did not take time for him to hit the ground running as he was soon ranked amongst the Hot 100 Young Football Stars in the World.</p><p>The following year, In 2011, there was a tussle between Venlo and the Nigerian Football Federation, who included the player in its team for the 2011 African Youth Championships. Venlo had declared their hot striker unavailable for the competition, but Nigeria would not go without him.</p><p>The two sides would eventually reach an agreement that allowed him to represent his country. Musa’s stock continued to rise after returning from the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, where he managed three goals with the Nigerian team that got to the quarter-finals stage.</p><p>He was notably shortlisted for the Adidas Golden Ball, the award given to the tournament’s most outstanding player. These achievements got the attention of teams across Europe as the hierarchy at Venlo revealed that Dutch giants Ajax were scouting the player and representatives from the English side Tottenham Hotspur.</p><p>The team further revealed that an unnamed German Bundesliga club put forward a last-minute €10 million bid for the player, which they turned down.&nbsp;Ahmed Musa stayed with Venlo for two seasons, a time during which he played 42 games and scored 10 goals in all competitions.</p><h3><strong>In 2012, Ahmed Musa Moved to CSKA Moscow</strong></h3><p>Ahmed Musa joined the Russian side CSKA Moscow in January 2012. Venlo reportedly received a fee in the region of €5 million. His first three years with his new team were impressive, and so he was rewarded with a four-year contract in 2015. While details of this contract were not made public, the striker finished the 2015–16 Russian Premier League season as the 5th highest scorer.</p><p>During his time in Russia, Ahmed Musa won the Russian Premier League title three times (2012–13, 2013–14, 2015–16), the Russian Cup once (2012-13), and the Russian Super Cup twice (2013 & 2014). He played a total of 167 games in all competitions and scored 55 goals before joining Leicester City.</p><h3><strong>He Spent Two Seasons In England With Leicester</strong></h3><p>Every football player worth their weight looks forward to getting the opportunity to play with the best of the best in the world. With the English Premier League being the best league globally, Musa expressed his desire to play in England, where other Nigerian greats like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jay-Jay Okocha</a>, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nwankwo Kanu</a>, among others, had showcased their talents.</p><p>This opportunity eventually came in 2016 when Leicester City paid a club-record £16.6 million for his services. His salary per week was further reported to be £60,000, about N33 million. Musa’s time with the team was not as good as he would have liked it to be, as he scored only 4 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions for the team in his first season.</p><p>In January 2018, at the middle of his second season in England, Musa was yet to feature on the team, and so he agreed to be loaned back to CSKA Moscow until the end of the season.</p><h3><strong>Ahmed Musa Moved to Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr in 2018</strong></h3><p>After a very poor two-year stint in England, Ahmed Musa agreed to move to Saudi Arabia to join Al Nassr. Leicester reportedly received about €16.5 million for the player. His time in the middle east proved to be quite successful, both financially and professionally. He became the highest-paid Nigerian player in history after signing a four-year contract worth N2.5 billion every year. He won the Saudi Professional League (2018–19) and Saudi Super Cup (2019) before announcing that he was leaving the team in October 2020.</p><h3><strong>Musa Briefly Returned Home To Play For Kano Pillars Before Signing For Turkish Side Fatih Karagümrük</strong></h3><p>After a few months of Ahmed Musa being linked to various teams across Europe, the striker returned to his roots to play for Kano Pillars. He chose to play for free for the Nigerian Premier League side and stayed with the team until the end of the 2020-21 season.</p><p>Musa later announced that he signed a deal to join Fatih Karagümrük in Turkey. While his transfer to the team was free, he earned a mouth-watering N1.02 billion salary every year.</p><p><strong>Recap Of Ahmed Musa’s Career Salaries</strong></p><ul><li>Kano Pillars (2009) – Undisclosed</li><li>VVV-Venlo (2010 – 2012) – Undisclosed</li><li>CSKA Moscow (2012 – 2016) – Undisclosed</li><li>Leicester City (2016 – 2018) – £60,000 or about N33 million per week</li><li>Al Nassr (2018 – 2020) – N2.5 billion every year</li><li>Kano Pillars (2020) – Free</li><li>Fatih Karagümrük (2021 – Present) – N1.02 billion every year</li></ul><h2><strong>Endorsement Deals Also Contributed to His Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Every professional football player in the world who has plied their trade at the top has at least one endorsement deal they can brag about. This could either be from sports apparel manufactures, soft drink companies, car manufacturing companies, electronics companies, etc.&nbsp;For a player like Ahmed Musa, who can boast of winning a couple of personal and team awards, he has had the luxury of being signed to different endorsement deals from several companies.</p><p>The striker’s first notable deal came in 2012 from an American multinational corporation, Nike. The sports apparel and equipment company <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>signed Musa</a> to a three-year contract. The striker was excited with the deal, saying that he had always been an admirer of Nike and has always worn their boots, specifically the elite light-weighted boots that allow him to run because it feels like he is not wearing any footwear. Musa joined Iniesta, Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovich, Wayne Rooney, etc., who were already Nike athletes at the time.</p><p>Many years later, in 2019, a few days to the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, Ahmed Musa was again in the headlines after he signed another lucrative endorsement deal. This time, the deal was with electronics manufacturer Syinix Limited. The player was announced as a brand ambassador for the company as it launched its new 65” big screen TV at an event in Sheraton Hotel, Lagos. He also signed on as an ambassador of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Skyline University Nigeria</a> that year.</p><p>Ahmed Musa’s most recent endorsement deal came in 2021 when the former Leicester forward was unveiled as the new brand ambassador of Pop Cola Soft Drink, a product of Mamuda Group of Companies in Kano. The event where he was unveiled as an ambassador was held at Tahir Guest Palace in Kano. In attendance were many people in government, including the Deputy Governor of Kano, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, and Special Adviser to the governor on Solid Minerals, Balaraba Ibrahim Ahmed.</p><h3><strong>Summary Of His Endorsement Deals</strong></h3><ul><li>Nike</li><li>Syinix Electronics</li><li>Skyline University</li><li>Pop Cola Soft Drink</li></ul><h2><strong>How The Football Player Spends His Money</strong></h2><p>Evidence of Ahmed Musa’s wealth can be seen in the type of cars he drives and the houses he owns. All over the athlete’s social media pages, it is evident that the Super Eagles star loves luxury cars that are always pictured in the garage in his magnificent mansion. Musa further has many houses and properties that are spread across Nigeria.</p><h3><strong>Musa Has a Fleet of Exotic Cars</strong></h3><ul><li>Range Rover Sport – $50,000</li></ul><p>With such massive net worth, Ahmed Musa acquired the Range Rover Sport in 2013, and it is one of the first cars he bought after moving to Europe. The vehicle, which is a middle-sized luxury SUV and spec product of British carmaker Land Rover, was a favorite of many football stars at the time.</p><ul><li>Range Rover Velar – $60,500 (N40m)</li></ul><p>In 2018, Musa appeared to have upgraded on his old Range Rover Sport by acquiring the Range Rover Velar, which he was seen driving around town. The vehicle, which is white in color, is the fourth model in the Range Rover series.</p><ul><li>2019 Mercedes Benz G-Wagon – $127,650 (N120M)</li></ul><p>Another vehicle that has become a favorite for many athletes is the Mercedes Benz G-Wagon. Musa acquired the 2019 version.</p><ul><li>Porsche Macan – N30m</li></ul><p>Musa appears to favor Sports Utility Vehicles over sedans as he also owns a Porshe Macan, a car made by a company known for making sports cars. The Macan maintains the characteristic sports car contours and is a practical vehicle that can accommodate many people, unlike the famous two-door Porshe sports cars.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned vehicles, other vehicles like a Mercedes-Benz GL (worth N15m), a Toyota Hilux (worth N20m), and a Toyota Hiace bus (worth N20m) have been pictured in his parking lot. Musa has further posed for pictures beside an all-black Range Rover SUV and a Mercedes-Benz C-Class that are not accounted for in many lists of his vehicles.</p><strong>List of Ahmed Musa’s Known Cars</strong><ul><li>Range Rover Sport – $50,000</li><li>Range Rover Velar – $60,500 (N40m)</li><li>2019 Mercedes Benz G-Wagon – $127,650 (N120M)</li><li>Porsche Macan – N30m</li><li>Mercedes-Benz GL – N15m</li><li>Toyota Hilux – N20m</li><li>Toyota Hiace bus – N20m</li></ul><h3><strong>He Has a Beautiful Mansion&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Musa grew up in the city of Jos in Plateau State. After he moved abroad and earned a decent salary for his services, the football player returned to the city, where he grew up to build a home. It was later reported that armed men had raided this house in 2013 to kidnap his family wife and kid. Thankfully, nobody was hurt in the attack, but the incident prompted the footballer to build another house in a better neighborhood with advanced security features.</p><p>Ahmed Musa’s new home was the toast of the town when it was completed. Some of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>amenities</a> that it came with are a swimming pool, a gym, a mosque, and a synthetic football field where he could play his favorite sport with family and friends when on holiday.</p><h3><strong>Ahmed Musa Also Gives Back to Society</strong></h3><p>Being the charitable person he is, Musa has built several community projects he hopes will help change the fortunes of many unfortunate people in Nigeria. How founded the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Ahmed Musa Neighbourhood Center</a> in Kaduna and the recently commenced <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>M & S International School project</a> in Bukuru, Jos South local government area of Plateau State.</p><h3><strong>The Football Star Has Been Married Three Times</strong></h3><p>Ahmed Musa has been married three times and divorced once. His first wife is a woman identified as Jamila. The pair were happily married until the football player made known his intention of marrying a second wife as permitted by Islamic law. This did not sit well with Jamila, and an altercation occurred at their residence in Leicester. The authorities were eventually called to their home, and Musa was reportedly arrested.</p><p>Following the incident, the pair opted to part ways in 2017. Later in the year, Musa went on to marry a second wife as he wedded Juliet Ejue. The pair have been happy together as Musa is always quick to shower her praises on his social media page.</p><p>In July 2021, word went around that Musa was marrying another wife. This was later confirmed after the athlete posted a picture of him and his new bride on his social media page. The lady was later identified to be Maryam Adamu Jajere from Yobe State.</p><p>Having been very successful in his career, Musa would definitely not be holding back to ensure that his wives and children are well taken care of. Wealthy Muslim men with many wives are known to have their wives living in separate homes of usually the same quality with everything they need provided. This would obviously set him back a huge chunk of his net worth, but Musa doesn’t seem to care as long as he continues making money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57wGaZq52RoLGww81mpp9lkZ26prCMpqysmaNiwKK4wKuwZpmemXqvsdNmrqiqpJ16qrqMp5iiqpFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
