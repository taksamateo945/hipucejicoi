She added, "It was hard for me to love the movie." (She later said she was "disheartened" her remarks became "the focus of my experience with the movie.")</p><p>But Rogen says he doesn't see how Heigl's new comedy, The Ugly Truth, makes women look even better.</p><p>"That [movie] looks like it really puts women on a pedestal in a beautiful way," he quipped on <strong>Howard Stern</strong>'s SIRIUS XM radio show on Thursday.</p><p>Added Apatow, "I hear there's a scene where she's wearing … Underwear … with a vibrator in it, so I'd have to see if that was uplifting for women."</p><p>See more celeb scandals</p><p>Apatow figured Heigl was "probably was doing six hours of interviews and kissing everyone's a**, and then just got tired and slipped a little bit" when she made the remarks to Vanity Fair.</p><p>Regardless, Rogen said, "I didn't slip and I was doing f****** interviews all day too … I didn't say s***!"</p><p>See famous celeb catfights</p><p>Even more baffling, said Apatow, "We never had a 'fight'" with Heigl while filming. "Seth always says, it doesn't make any sense [because] she improvised half her s***," Apatow said, adding that she "could not have been cooler."</p><p>Apatow said he hasn't spoken to Heigl since her remarks. He doesn't know if he'd make a big deal about it, either.</p><p>See Katherine Heigl and other stars acting goofy</p><p>"It all depends on how much coffee I have had that day," he said. "If I was fighting … with someone else about something I may handle it wrong, and if I'm in like total Buddha mood, I'd be like 'I feel sad that she hasn't learned the lesson of her journey yet,'" he said.</p><p>After the remark, "[You think] at some point I'll get a call saying 'Sorry, I was tired…' and then the call never comes,'" he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>See today's top celeb news photos</p><p>Rogen said he doesn't feel bad since Heigl seems to run her mouth and most people, including Grey's Anatomy staff.</p><p>"I gotta say it's not like we're the only people she said some bat **** crazy things about," he said. "That's kind of her bag now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmon5Wjeqyt06Gcq6Gemnqpscigo2aho2K1urzOnKmirJmYrq15xaipZpuRobmqusZmoqenk6CypXnUqWSsnaiewLV5kWlncmtgbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
