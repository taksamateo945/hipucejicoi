Kylie Jenner is celebrating Valentine’s Day looking sexier than ever while at it.</p><p>As rumors swirl that Kylie has reconciled with her baby daddy, Travis Scott; she decided to send tongues wagging by sharing a few stunning pictures on social media.</p><p>Stormi Webster’s mother opted for a skin-tight red outfit and sleek hairstyle for the event.</p><p>Meanwhile, reliable sources have made clear to TMZ and E! that the former couple has rekindled the flames of love. Entertainment Tonight said they are in love and dating on the down-low.</p><p>Another tipster told Hollywood Life: “Kylie and Travis truly enjoy one another and are in love, but it can often be hard navigating their lives at such a young age. The couple needed to take a step back to reevaluate many things, but in doing so, they are better now than ever.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8U0mmhHvkJ/</p><p>The same insider explained: “Kylie and Travis are avoiding putting a label on things because as soon as they do, they are going to get hit with a million opinions. And right now they just don’t want to deal with that. They are still figuring stuff out and are trying to slow it all down.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8Yeu3YH4rU/</p><p>The person in the know went on to say: “They’re spending a lot of time together, and neither of them is seeing anyone else. But they also spend plenty of time doing their own thing. Kylie is often doing stuff with her girls, or even just her and Stormi and her family. She’s making a big point to keep her independence right now. That’s very important to her.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8ZaRuEHNEf/</p><p>The pal shared: “They both have so much stuff happening with the careers that they tend to focus on all of that. And when they are together, the focus is mostly on Stormi, and there isn’t time for the love and affection. They are really trying to figure out the best way to get back to the romantic side of things, and that is taking some time. They are trying to make the right moves to return to what they had, but it is still a work in progress.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8f0AW_ni4b/</p><p>The observer concluded: “It’s also something that is 50/50 on what way it will ultimately lean for them. They still need a lot more hanging out to do to determine if they can be a fully committed couple again. It is a tough time that they are navigating through. They can only hope for the best and are deciding to try. But they are fully aware that there are no guarantees moving forward besides being loving parents.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Will they make things official again?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebrrmqsYyjnKemlad6qa3SZqmem5%2BjsKq4xJ1ksKGknXq1vsCvoKxlo5i8tcCMqKVmrJiaeqW71qdkpaenYq6vsIytn56rlWK%2FprCMoaatZaaWuaa606Klnqtdma66ec%2Bhpq2no2K1osLEZp2apqNitLax0qygp59daIN5hJNyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
