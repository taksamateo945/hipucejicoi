That being said, the KUWTK star was even in attendance at her rapper ex’s album listening event!</p><p>So, how does she feel about Ye writing music about their divorce?</p><p>While her family’s reality show is over now, which means that Kim’s failed marriage is not really going to be a topic of discussion for her on-screen, that is not to say it’s not still going to be talked about publicly!</p><p>After all, her former husband is a rapper who likes to draw inspiration from his life while writing music!</p><p>One source told E! News that Kimye are doing much better, having a stronger relationship that they have developed by co-parenting their four kids after the split.</p><p>So while it was previously reported that they were not even on speaking terms in the divorce’s aftermath, they are now definitely communicating and being in each other’s lives for the sake of the young ones.</p><p>This comes after one source previously told E! News that Kanye had changed his phone number so he and Kim could only communicate through their legal teams.</p><p>With that being said, it sounds like they’ve made some considerable progress.</p><p>Another insider told the same news outlet that ‘Kim and Kanye are doing great now. Now that the pressure of their marriage is off, they’re on the same page as friends. They reconnected a few months ago and they have been easing into a friendship now.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>They went on to share that ‘Kanye did write a song about Kim and their marriage and Kim gave her input about it. He was very respectful and gave her the heads-up, and didn’t want to blindside her. He respects Kim a lot and he wants to keep the family united. Now that they’ve had space, Kim feels relieved they can be cordial and spend time together for the sake of the kids again.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsS1t4ykoKZlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2dsrOx0mafqK9dqLWmecWenKWrXZavsMHTZqKapqmaerix0q1ksKqZqbavs4yspqefo2Kuo7vUrWStoJWev26wyK%2Bmq5uVYoF6g5BtZ2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
