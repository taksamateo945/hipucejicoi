Nevertheless, after high school, the young record producer went to New York City.</p><p class=align-left>However, there is no information available yet on who Kenny Beats' girlfriend is.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>While in New York City, Beats <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">applied as an intern</a> under the indie rap impresario Jonny Shipes and his Cinematic Music Group without pay or credit.
