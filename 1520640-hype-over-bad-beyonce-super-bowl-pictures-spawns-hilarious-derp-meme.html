One brief whiff of the hubbub and the Internets were off and running.&nbsp;</p><p>For those uninitiated, Beyonce performed at the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> halftime show, a fact that is more than likely greeted with the response of, "no duh."</p><p>Alas, some of the pictures from that show were less than flattering, according to Beyonce's own publicist. It seems the pictures posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> weren't well received and the website was asked to take them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the website who wanted to break down the fiercest moments from the show received a letter from the singer's camp to take it all down, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then promptly printed the letter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, it was on and popping, the Internet is creating memes and there ain't no stopping.&nbsp;</p><p>You see, one does not simply erase a photo from the Internet. Once you hit publish, tweet or upload, it is there for eternity, solidified like Han Solo in carbonite.</p><p>Oh, you can ask for the Internet to forget, but they never forget. I certainly hope Beyonce's publicist knew this, and was counting on the mere mention causing an even bigger wave of hype for what was a fantastic halftime show.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from that, let's go ahead and say that the pop star is obviously one of the most gorgeous people in the world. The "bad" photos were obviously cherry-picked from moments when her dance moves caused some awkward faces.</p><p>The best course of action would have been to say, we can all make silly faces and move on.</p><p>But if you ask the crazy Interwebz not to do something, they are going to push back the other way. You only have to take a gander at places like Imgur and Reddit to know that you must brace yourselves, Beyonce memes are coming.</p><p>Hit me up on Twitter for more me-me-me-memes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5qYGuBcXnHsqeeZZ%2BrsrN5wZqbZpqVrryvr8Rmqq6olad6o7vWpWSpoZOpwrOx0maqqZmno8ButMilmKuhn6rAbrDEq6dmpZWisg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
