It was only a baby shark but they’d preserved it in this tube for us. That was odd. They didn’t even leave a note explaining. It was just, ‘Here’s a dead shark.'”</p><p>(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Mercedes-Benz)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/179980865.jpg alt='"Supermensch: The Legend Of Shep Gordon" Premiere - Arrivals - 2013 Toronto International Film Festival' width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>7.

However, despite her level of fame, the&nbsp;25 year-old Pennsylvania native has maintained a great relationship with her fans. One fan decided to put that relationship to the test when he/she sent Swift a turtle shell with Swift’s portrait painted on it. Although receiving a portrait is usually flattering, there’s something about it being painted on a turtle’s shell that changes everything.</p><p>(Photo by Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/465564295.jpg alt='Premiere Of Focus Features&#39; "That Akward Moment" - Red Carpet' width=641 height=466 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>3.

Jared Leto – Ear</strong></p><p>If an actor’s skill can be judged based on what fans are willing to give, then Jared Leto must be one of the greatest actors of all-time. In 2013, Leto received an ear – yes, an actual human ear –&nbsp;as a gift from one of his fans. According to Leto, “Someone cut their ear off once and sent it to me, that was very strange.&nbsp;The note just said, ‘Are you listening?’. I never knew who it was, who’s missing their ear out there.” Leto posted the photo on Instagram, borrowing the caption “are you listening?” causing many of his fans to comment in disgust.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/468457929.jpg alt="Dolly Parton Press Conference" width=640 height=462 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolly Parton</strong></p><p>Dolly Parton is the most successful female country singer of all time, and one of the most successful female artists&nbsp;of all-time. &nbsp;Over the years, Parton has become a fan favorite, and her bubbly personality has helped her become a very relatable public figure. &nbsp;Apparently, one of Parton’s fans was so moved by the star that she felt that Parton would make a great mother for her new-born child. In 2014, Parton revealed that she had once received a baby as a gift from a fan who left the baby with a note stating: “My name is Jolene. &nbsp;I’m your biggest fan, and I want to give you my baby.”</p><p>(Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWnlrCstcSsq2afmZvBtHnCnqOemqKewaqx0macr52iYrSwwNOepWaekaPAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
