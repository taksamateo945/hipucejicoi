Demand for meat had risen as well as the demand for feathers for women’s hats, so in order to make hunting easier, hunters began looking into ways to kill multiple ducks at once, and with much more ease.</p><p>Enter: the punt gun.</p><p>Custom-built and <a href=# rel=noopener>clocking in at over</a> eight feet long and two inches in diameter, the shotgun packed a punch. Firing over a pound of ammunition at once, the gun could kill between 50 and 100 waterfowl with one shot, leaving their bodies floating on the surface for the hunters to collect.</p><p>The gun usually featured a single barrel instead of a double, though double barrel versions did exist, they didn’t fire nearly as many powerful shots as their single-barreled counterparts.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-389005 alt="Young Men With Punt Gun" width=800 height=680 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/young-men-with-punt-gun.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-389005 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Reddit</span><span class=caption-body>A colorized image of two young men carrying a punt gun or duck shooter, a weapon outlawed due to how severely it depleted North America’s population of waterfowl.</span></p><p>But even though the gun was wildly effective, it was too big for one hunter to use by himself. So, the hunters developed punt boats that could hold the weight and size of the gun. These boats were long and slender with enough room inside for one gun and one man. And when the guns fired, the boat would actually be blown back several feet.</p><p>Soon, hunters developed a method that resulted in maximum hunting profits.</p><p>Working in groups of eight to 10 boats, the hunters would circle around an entire flock of waterfowl. Coordinating their shots, they would fire at once. In under a minute, a handful of hunters could take out an entire flock of birds, sometimes 500 at once.</p><h2>Too Effective For Its Own Good</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170965 alt="Man With Punt Gun" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/man-with-punt-gun.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-170965 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The powerful weapon proved too deadly to North American duck populations and was eventually outlawed for use by 1918.</span></p><p>Unfortunately, the punt gun wasn’t destined to last. The weapons industry didn’t support the oversized, cumbersome design, and it was never mass produced.</p><p>Additionally, the guns proved to be too deadly. As one American market hunter named Ray Todd <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a>, he and three other hunters once killed an entire flock of ducks “over a half-mile long and nearly as wide.”</p><p>He added that by morning, “We had killed over 1,000 ducks … it was the best night’s work we had ever done.”</p><p>It almost goes without saying that before long, waterfowl populations in the United States began to fall dramatically.</p><p>Their numbers had dropped so much due to the effectiveness of the gun, that the U.S. government worked to pass legislation that would make both market hunting and the transport of game across state lines illegal. In fact, it was hunters for sport and not for market that pushed this legislation forward.</p><p>Between 1900 and 1918, a series of federal laws were enacted that effectively outlawed the punt gun, along with punt boats. Though it is still legal to own a punt gun in the United States, it is not permitted to use one.</p><h2>The Use Of Punt Guns Today</h2><p>Today, punt guns are a novelty item, with less than 100 in use around the world. In the United States, they exist mostly as a collector’s item or a piece of history for gun collectors with a penchant for the unusual. In the United Kingdom, however, they get a little more use.</p><p>Less than 50 of the guns are still in use in the U.K., and when they are, it’s usually ceremonial. There are restrictions on punt gun usage across the country, most of which insist upon smaller barrel sizes and less ammunition. In ceremonies, the guns are used mostly to celebrate royalty.</p><p>Upon her 1897 Diamond Jubilee, for instance, Queen Victoria requested a punt gun salute. Since then, every coronation and jubilee in the United Kingdom has been honored with such a salute. Indeed, during the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2012, a 21-punt gun salute was fired.</p><p>Though North America’s waterfowl are safe from punt guns, ducks across America are disappearing today due to widespread habitat loss and climate change.</p><p>After reading about the punt gun, check out <a href=#>the killdozer</a>, another oversized weapon of mass destruction.
