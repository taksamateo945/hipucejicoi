He announced he was cutting off travel from Europe to the U.S. for 30 days. The restrictions did not apply to the United Kingdom.</p><p>“For all Americans, it is essential that everyone takes extra precautions and practice good hygiene,” Trump said. “Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus.”</p><p>Shortly thereafter, actor Tom Hanks announced on social media that he and his wife actress Rita Wilson had contracted the coronavirus.</p><p>Hanks said the two were in Australia and felt a bit tired, had colds and some body aches. He said Wilson also suffered chills and slight fevers.</p><p>“To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive,” Hanks said.</p><p>The couple would recover from the virus and Hanks would go on to host “Saturday Night Live” remotely from his home in April.</p><p>The sports world’s months-long pause would start to take shape on this date. Our sister station ESPN produced a “30 for 30” podcast episode called “March 11 2020,” in which <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>they describe that Wednesday as the “day everything changed.”</a></p><p>Around that time of Tom Hank’s social media post, the NBA announced it was suspending its season after a player on the Utah Jazz, later identified as Rudy Gobert, tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>“The NBA is suspending gameplay following the conclusion of [Wednesday’s] schedule of games until further notice,” the league said in a statement issued shortly after 9:30 p.m. “The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”</p><p>The shortened NBA season eventually continued in the summer.</p><p>Earlier in the day, the NCAA announced it would have no fans at its upcoming March Madness tournaments.</p><p>“While I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement.</p><p>A day later, the NCAA would cancel the tournaments.</p><p>Copyright © 2021 WLS-TV.
