That being said, the famous actress opened up about her determination to stay just as ‘vibrant’ and to thrive even into her 100s!</p><p>Jennifer Aniston will not be slowing down when it comes to her career and just life in general!</p><p>The <a href=#>Friends</a> star takes really good care of herself, so there is no real reason why living to reach the honorable age of 100 and even past that is not a realistic goal for the Hollywood starlet.</p><p>During a new interview for the LA Times, Aniston dished that ‘I look at my dad, who only just turned 87, and he’s Greek — stubborn, fabulous, all of those things from that generation — but, you know, I believe they could be a little bit healthier. He is going to be mad at me. You know, my mother, c’mon, none of you guys took care of yourselves. But they did not know any better. But now we know. So what is our excuse?’</p><p>The Hollywood star went on to share some of her secrets when it comes to living a healthy and happy life.</p><p>‘It’s about knowing what you put inside your body and exercising — my father, never — they did not know you could keep your bones strong, never mind also being fit and just fitting into a certain size-whatever.

I’d like to be vibrant and thriving.’</p><p>During the same interview, <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> also discussed the first season of The Morning Show, which, according to her, was like therapy for her!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The A-lister stressed that it was a cathartic experience and why.
