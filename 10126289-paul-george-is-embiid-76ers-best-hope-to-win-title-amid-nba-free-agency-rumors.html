He is also an incredibly unselfish player for someone of his stature, content to play the setup man for others, as we have seen at every stop in his professional career.</p><p>He has no problem playing a No. 2, dishing the ball to his teammates and putting them in the best position to succeed, then dropping back in defense and playing gritty ball when necessary. He does not have to capture the headlines, trend on social media for his dazzling offense or overshadow his teammates.</p><p>That will endear him to Embiid, too, who has plenty left in the tank and remains the current face of the Philadelphia franchise.</p><p>From a statistical standpoint, George brings undeniable numbers to the table.</p><p>In 33.8 minutes of work per game in 2023-24, he averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, a field goal percentage of 47.1, and a three-point percentage of 41.3. Most impressive were the shooting percentages, which were the highest of his 14-year career.</p><p>Add to them his 90.7 percent from the foul line, a full three-percent uptick from a season earlier, and you have a legitimate superstar who has not rested on his reputation but, rather, continues to put the work in to be better than he was.</p><p>It is no wonder that the 76ers and other contending teams, such as the Golden State Warriors, are eager to sign George.</p>Bleacher Report <span class=acct>@BleacherReport</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Warriors are prepared to offer PG a 4-year max via opt-in and trade, per &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WindhorstESPN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WindhorstESPN&lt;/a> ðŸ˜®ðŸ’° &lt;a href="https://t.co/uKdYa1DyWv">pic.twitter.com/uKdYa1DyWv&lt;/a></p><p>None, though, need him and would benefit as much as the Sixers would, particularly in an Atlantic Division that is home to the NBA champion Boston Celtics and a New York Knicks team that got exponentially better over the last few days with a trade for Mikal Bridges and the re-signing of OG Anunoby.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmt%2FeYWMqZiupF2csrC%2Bxp5koqtdmrqjtcidZHBulafAbq7ErKtmoJ%2Blsm7AzmauoqZdqba1uMRmmKahlGK7o62Mn6menV2WtKa6wrJkq62dpL%2B0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
