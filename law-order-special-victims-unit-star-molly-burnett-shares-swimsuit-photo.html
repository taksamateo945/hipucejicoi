Burnett, 35, who plays Detective Grace Muncy on the show, shared highlights of her fall so far, including a picture of her laughing in the sun in a hot-pink bikini. "The fall üçÇ," she captioned the post. "Your smile and laugh tho -UNMATCHED!!!!üòçüòçüòç," commented </span><i><span>Selling Sunset </span></i><span>star Chrishell Stause. Here's what Burnett's health and wellness regimen looks like.</span></p><p><span>Burnett starts her day with an energy bar before hitting the gym. "Eating healthy is very important to me, especially in the morning before a workout," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Perfect Bars are my go-to for a quick healthy pre-workout snack to kick start my day. I love getting my day started with a high-intensity workout. Orange Theory lets me get my cardio and strength training in, all in the course of one hour. If I have time in the morning, I love to put Colin Cowherd's 'The Herd' sports show on while I do my chores and work. He keeps me up to date on everything happening in the sports world!"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_183938684.jpg><p><span>Burnett's work as an actor has taught her empathy. "Creating characters and figuring out why people do the things they do, for a living, has absolutely allowed me to be more understanding and compassionate to the differences that exist between people with diverse backgrounds and experiences," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I think the most important thing is to really love what you do. This career demands so much patience and determination. As long as you continue to remember you're pursuing acting for the love of it, you will continue to find fulfillment."</span></p><p><span>Burnett makes time for self-care whenever she can. "One of my favorite things to do if I have some free time in the afternoon is curl up on my patio with a good book!" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I'm currently reading AMORALMAN by Derek DelGaudio, which I highly recommend.&nbsp; A good smelling house is a must. Bath and Body Works are my go-to for scents! I switch it up each season, so right now my favorite scent is Passionfruit Banana Flower. Good music helps to keep the afternoon crash at bay. I love R&B and Hip Hop. Mac Miller and J. Cole are my go-to artists."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Burnett is obsessed with sneakers. "I am a big sneakerhead! My first pair was the Retro 1 Air Jordans," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I think the growth in sneaker culture can be attributed to the fact that more pop culture icons today have their own sneaker lines. From hip hop artists to athletes to designers and beyond. Social media has definitely increased the amount of sneaker exposure."</span></p><p><span>Burnett meditates in the evenings and winds down with her skincare routine. "It's hard to find time to meditate in the morning for me, so I usually wind down with an easy 10-minute meditation on my Calm app. Highly recommend!" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "My mom taught me the importance of a fresh clean face before bed. I take off my makeup and slather Tatcha's The Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream, followed by Tatcha's Water Cream moisturizer."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK2t1mamq5yVp3q0vMScoJqkXau2pMDIpqpmrZ6ewW6%2F05qpZqWfobm6ecGuqaedpKl6tLTAq5ysZaOstq6%2F1KKrZqiYpMGwew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
