Raiola has strong ties there thanks to his father, former Cornhuskers offensive lineman (and 14-year NFL veteran) Dominic Raiola, a 2000 consensus All-American who has his No. 54 jersey retired. His uncle is current Nebraska offensive line coach Donovan Raiola.</p><p>The 6'3", 230-pound Raiola is expected to visit Nebraska on Friday, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a>.</p><p>Raiola sports great potential wherever he goes collegiately, and he could very well be playing on Sundays down the road too.</p><p>Andrew Ivins, the director of scouting for <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a>, filed a report for Raiola in August that read in part:</p><p>"A big-armed passer that has what it takes to be the centerpiece of an offense given how he can sling it around the yard from the pocket or on the move," Ivins wrote.</p><p>"Owns a college-ready frame at a verified 6-foot-3, 220-pounds and is a better athlete than he gets credit for as he can buy himself time and extend plays in the face of pressure."</p><p>Ivins said Raiola might need time at his next stop before taking over but mentioned NFL potential.</p><p>"Must buy into the process at the program of his choice, but has the natural talent to be a true difference marker on Saturdays and then eventually Sundays if he can avoid setbacks," Ivins wrote.</p><p>"Might need a redshirt year or two before he's ready to go, but appears to be ahead of the curve."</p><p>Raiola's season with Buford is over after an 11-2 campaign in which he threw for 34 touchdowns and just one interception. Now the question is where he will be playing on Saturdays. The date to watch will be Dec. 20, when college football players can sign their national letter of intent to kick off the <a href=# rel=noopener>early signing period</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGWFeoOMbmSsrJGnerKujKucnKqlnsFusNilmKdlopa2sLjAZquoZaaewKrAjKecm6qRqLiiecOeqqmhpJp6qLHOq56imV2YvK65yK2knqak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
