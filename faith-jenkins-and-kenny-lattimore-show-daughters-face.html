Audience members were overcome with excitement as well.</p><p>This year will be the first in which Faith Jenkins celebrates Mother’s Day as a mom. The judge took to Instagram a few weeks ago to share her <a href=#>thoughts about motherhood</a>.</p><p>“A few thoughts on my new life in this capacity,” Faith began. “It was on this day at 11 weeks post-partum that I realized I could no longer fit a single pre-pregnancy shoe in my closet,” Jenkins revealed. “Clothes, I expected, but the shoes … why lawd,” the new mom jokingly asked.</p><p>Faith was happy to stay home with her daughter but also excited to get back to work so baby Skylar could see both sides of the coin. “I’m happy to be back at work and Skylar gets to see her mom in action,” the celebrity mom told her fans.<br>Mother’s Day in the United States is this Sunday (May 14).</p><p>Photo: Sherri/YouTube</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWxmaW1fZn9wssCiq6Flmpq7rLXNrGSappRiuKa6zbJkpZmkqbauu9GeZKygn6x6pa3UoJ%2BtnaKoeqetwp5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
