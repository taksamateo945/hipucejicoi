Arriving ahead of United's victorious 2010/11 season, he announced himself in the Community Shield against <a href=#>Chelsea</a>. The goal he scored in that match was very scrappy, bouncing off his foot, into his face and in. However, over the course of that season, the 19 competitive goals he managed showed that his eye for goal was no accident.</p><p>He scored with both feet and both the front and back of his head. Fans quickly got used to seeing him line up a side-footed, putter-like shot and beat the 'keeper.</p><img alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - MAY 08: Javier Hernandez of Manchester United scores the opening goal during the Barclays Premier League match between Manchester United and Chelsea at Old Trafford on May 8, 2011 in Manchester, England.

Within a minute of Hernandez's pre-game, centre-circle prayers he had put United 1-0 up and sent Old Trafford into raptures. It was a moment in which it felt like the Little Pea had won United the league.</p><p>He has rarely hit the same heights since.</p><p>Until Sir Alex Ferguson left United, Hernandez at least retained his shooting boots, but the seeds of his future difficulties were sown.</p><img alt="LONDON, ENGLAND - JANUARY 20: Robin van Persie of Manchester United looks on during the Barclays Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United at White Hart Lane on January 20, 2013 in London, England.

Then Ferguson signed Robin van Persie in the summer of 2012.</p><p>Sir Alex made an apparently throwaway remark, when discussing his abundance of attacking talent, in September 2012. He was asked whether Van Persie and <a href=#>Wayne Rooney</a> could play together and said that they could (h/t the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Telegraph</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Van Persie is flexible because he can play in different positions, from the right, in behind the strikers. He is such a mobile player, there are great options with him. And Wayne can play behind and he can play up.</p><p>Chicharito is the only one-position player and that is through the middle.</p><p>Even as the "only one-position player," Sir Alex still managed to make effective use of the Mexican. Scoring 18 goals in 36 appearances, Hernandez managed his best ratio of goals to games in any of his United seasons during 2012/13.</p><p>He went on a run of seven goals in five games in October and November 2012, giving Ferguson a significant selection headache. He never cemented a first-team place, though, and then Hernandez's problems at United got a lot worse.</p><img alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - MARCH 29: Manchester United Manager David Moyes substitutes Wayne Rooney for Javier Hernandez during the Barclays Premier League match between Manchester United and Aston Villa at Old Trafford on March 29, 2014 in Manchester, Englan" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/001/662/520/02d9056c8cd2a73cb9aebad148cb3ac8_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/001/662/520/02d9056c8cd2a73cb9aebad148cb3ac8_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span><p>In summer 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson retired, to be replaced by David Moyes.</p><p>Moyes did not have Sir Alex's experience of keeping an elite squad happy. His disastrous tenure saw him under such pressure for results that he rarely experimented with his selections.</p><p>Consequently, Hernandez did not start many games. By the latter part of the season, his "non celebration" in front of the Stretford End when he scored against <a href=#>Aston Villa</a> indicated just how unhappy he was. It could not have stood in starker contrast to the joie de vivre with which he celebrated his early goals at United.</p><p>Hernandez's United career went wrong because Sir Alex bought Robin van Persie and selected David Moyes as his successor once he retired.</p><p>It also went wrong because he offers more limited options than his colleagues. He is not able to make the same contribution to build-up play as Rooney or Van Persie. His finishing is superb, but under Moyes United struggled to create chances for him.</p><p>While this article asks "why did it go wrong," the truth is that his United career has been anything but unsuccessful.</p><img alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - MAY 12: Javier Hernandez of Manchester United celebrates with the trophy and team-mates Anderson (r) and Rafael (l) following the Barclays Premier League match between Manchester United and Swansea City at Old Trafford on May 12, 20" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/001/662/522/7c8f27c18db01038d1893c58a0ad8627_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/001/662/522/7c8f27c18db01038d1893c58a0ad8627_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span><p>He made a major contribution to two league titles, won the hearts of many United fans and started in a Champions League final.</p><p>Perhaps he never hit the dizziest heights of super stardom, but he has hardly been a flop.</p><p>He remains too good to be wasted on United's bench and not good enough to break into the first team.
