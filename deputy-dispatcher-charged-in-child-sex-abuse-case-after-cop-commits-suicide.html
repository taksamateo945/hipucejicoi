[Internal Affairs} Chief Harrison spoke to Johnson for hours, because it was important to us to try to prevent a suicide, and to most importantly get every and any and all facts relative to this case that we could get from him,” Rosen said.</p><p>“Johnson confessed to everything he had done and he implicated two other employees at this office, Christina McKay and Deputy Chonda Williams.”</p><p>After the “thorough confession,” the deputy turned the gun on himself, Rosen said.</p><p>“There was just no indication whatsoever that a guy like this had these demons in him,” the emotional constable explained.</p><p>“He’s going to have to answer to that with his maker. I can’t do anything for him. The only thing I can do is be here for these victims,” Rosen said.</p><p>“Everybody around this guy had no idea that he was a pedophile”</p><p>McKay and Williams were “terminated, charged and arrested,” in connection with the case. They were being held at the Brazoria County Jail.</p><p>The FBI has joined the investigation and authorities are working to determine if additional children were abused.</p><p>“Nobody saw this coming,” Rosen said. “This has been a tragic week and we pray for the victims.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJq9tsDYZpuiq6CWwaS0xKtknKCRp7SmsIyipWabmJ65pXnSnq9mmZKqwKZ5wpqqnmWRm8Gmvoycpqllk6S6rrXTrGSsrZmYtqWxjniYpqg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
