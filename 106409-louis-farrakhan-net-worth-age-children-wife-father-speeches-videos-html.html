Regardless of how they acquired their popularity, one denominator is that their fans always pry on their personal life. One of the aspects that fans always want to know is the net worth.</p><p class=align-left>Farrakhan is believed to have a decent net worth, however, people honestly can not tell how much it is. So before we state his net worth, let us look at some of his income sources:</p><h3>His leadership roles</h3><p class=align-left>This <a href=#>celebrity</a> is the Nation of Islam (NOI) leader, an African American movement that blends some aspects of the <a href=#>Islamic religion</a> with Black Nationalism. He took over this role back in 1965 after the assassination of Malcolm X. Since then, he has been the leader, and his salary is believed to have contributed a significant amount of his net worth.</p><h3>His music</h3><p class=align-left>Before becoming NOI's leader, young Louis Farrakhan was initially in the <a href=#>music</a> industry. His music career has also contributed to his net worth, given that he has produced several mega-hits like <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Black Family Day</a></i>. These are the two known income streams of this controversial spiritual leader. His net worth as of 2021 is estimated to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$5 million</a>.</p><h2>Louis Farrakhan's biography</h2><p class=align-left>Farrakhan is one of the leading lights of the Islamic community. He has been a disciple since the era of Malcolm X. But what is the back story behind this leader?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/75f18d8d944b5afe.jpg><h3>How old is Louis Farrakhan?</h3><p class=align-left>He was born on 11th May 1933 in The Bronx, New York, as Louis Eugene Walcott. He is currently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">88 years</a> old. Who are Louis Farrakhan's parents? They are Sarah Mae and Pervical Clark. Nonetheless, his mother raised him because Louis Farrakhan's father Pervical left them even before his birth.</p><p class=align-left>By the time Sarah's and Pervical's relationship ended, she had started living with Walcott. The relationship blossomed, and Walcott became a stepfather to Eugene and his older brother. Unfortunately, Walcott passed away in 1936, and the family relocated to Boston.</p><p class=align-left>Here, Eugene attended Boston Latin School and the English High School. He won a <a href=#>track scholarship</a> to attend Winston Salem <a href=#>Teachers College</a>. Unfortunately, he had to drop out of college as he had just been wedded and his wife had a baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/972dd4fe3d1d5e29.jpg><h2>When did Louis Farrakhan join the nation of Islam (NOI)?</h2><p class=align-left>It all dates back to the 50s when Eugene used to tour America under the aliases Calypso Gene and The Charmer. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Around 1955</a>, he learned of NOI from his pal Rodney Smith who then invited him to the group's Saviour's Day.</p><p class=align-left>In July of the same year, he officially joined the group and was called Louis X before receiving his Islamic name Farrakhan. He quickly started climbing up the ranks and was soon appointed Malcolm X's assistant minister. He replaced Malcolm as Boston's temple minister after Malcolm was transferred to a New York's temple. So Louis Farrakhan and Malcolm X were now serving as <a href=#>ministers</a> at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>However, after Malcolm was assassinated in 1965, Minister Louis Farrakhan was promoted to a few positions that Malcolm X initially held. For example, he became NOI's national spokesman and representative and a minister at the prominent Harlem Mosque until 1975.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/15892574a486b64c.jpg><h3>Louis Farrakhan's speeches</h3><p class=align-left>The NOI leader has routinely made bizarre accusations against the Jews, and over the years, his charges have only become more belligerent. For example, during a speech on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 2nd February 2018</a> during Saviour's Day, he said, <i>The Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behaviour that Hollywood is putting out: turning men into women, and women into men</i>.</p><h3>Louis Farrakhan's YouTube 2021</h3><p class=align-left><a href=#>These speeches</a>, which you can obtain by looking at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the YouTube videos,</a> have sparked criticism and praise, even from celebrities. Some of the celebrities who have been in the spotlight for supporting Louis Farrakhan's philosophies are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chelsea Handler</a> and <a href=#>NFL player</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DeSean Jackson</a>.</p><h2>Who is Louis Farrakhan's wife?</h2><p class=align-left>Eugene's spouse is Betsy Ross, better known as Khadijah Farrakhan. The two tied the knot in 1953. They have nine children together: Mustapha, Louis Jr., Abnar, Donna, Betsy-Jean, Maria, Joshua, Fatimah, and Khallada. Sadly, Louis Jr. passed away in 2018 after suffering a fatal heart condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2897ca586b92f4d2.jpg><h2>Louis Farrakhan's house</h2><p class=align-left>Farrakhan has a couple of homes. One home was designed back in the 70s by <a href=#>famous Egyptian</a> architect M. Momen. It allegedly has twenty rooms.</p><p class=align-left>Louis Eugene Walcott, popularly known as Louis Farrakhan, is one of the most controversial spiritual leaders.
