I'm going to try to do whatever I can to be what I am to the teammates and the fans and try to do whatever I can to be that positive role model in this here locker room because that's what matters."</p><p>Dehner noted there is still a civil case pending against the running back and cases outstanding against his sister and trainer regarding an incident near his home in which a minor was shot during a game of "Nerf Wars."</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Ben Baby</a> noted Mixon was not a suspect in the criminal investigation for that incident.</p><p>"I felt what's understood don't need to be explained," Mixon said when asked if he ever explained the various situations to his teammates, per Dehner.</p><p>"Everybody on the team knew what it was. Everybody knew what it is. In terms of that, I'm just going to keep on doing what I can to keep on being that positive role model around here. I'm just going to keep on doing what I can to building the leader and camaraderie around the locker room."</p><p>Baby reported Sunday that Mixon said he would not be speaking with specific reporters from ESPN, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i> and Pro Football Network because of what he saw as disrespectful treatment.</p><p>His agent, Peter Schaffer, also responded to Baby:</p>Peter Schaffer <span class=acct>@peterjschaffer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>You know exactly why we don't talk to you. You consistently look for the negative and always are putting the players down. &lt;br>&lt;br>We have given you ample chances to correct the situation and you refuse. You made your bed now sleep in it. Don't tweet to people that you don't know why.</p><p>As for the aggravated menacing case in which Mixon was found not guilty, police said he pointed a gun at a woman. Yet a municipal court judge said prosecutors did not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt when issuing the ruling, per Baby.</p><p>The 2023 campaign will be his seventh with the team that selected him with a second-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft. He ran for 814 yards and seven touchdowns at 3.9 yards per carry last season, which was a dropoff from the 1,205 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground at 4.1 yards per carry he posted in 2021.</p><p>Cincinnati starts its 2023 season on Sept. 10 against the Cleveland Browns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGuFdIWMm5ynn5GhwG62zp5kpqGopLturcOdqZ6ro5rAbrvFn2SfoZWhsW610qysnqtdrK6vwNJmq6hlkpp6sbvSoquirpViv7C4xGakqJyVoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
