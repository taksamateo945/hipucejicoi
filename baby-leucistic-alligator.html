Three of those gators now live at Gatorland in Orlando, and the newborn alligator is the offspring of one of those gators.</p><p>“This is beyond ‘rare,'” McHugh said. “It is absolutely extraordinary!”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-467276 alt="Mark McHugh" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/img1974.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-467276 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Gatorland</span><span class=caption-body>Gatorland President and CEO Mark McHugh announced the arrival of the new leucistic baby alligator.</span></p><p>The actual number of leucistic alligators in the wild is impossible to determine, but the baby gator is just the eighth documented specimen in existence, and the first one born in captivity.</p><p>While similar to albinism, which is a genetic disorder causing a lack of pigmentation, leucism is a partial loss of pigmentation, often resulting in splotchy coloring. Animals with leucism typically have normal-colored eyes, while those with albinism often have red or pink eyes, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Smithsonian Magazine</a>. The condition also causes extreme sun sensitivity.</p><p>“Leucistic alligators are the rarest genetic variation in the American alligator,” stated a news release from Gatorland. “Leucism in alligators causes white coloration, but they often have patches or splotches of normal coloration on their skin. Without the darker skin pigmentation, they can’t have direct sunlight for long periods of time because they sunburn easily.”</p><p>Leucistic gators also lack the American gator’s protective green camouflage, making them easy prey in the wild.</p><p>The leucistic baby gator born at Gatorland weighs just 3.4 ounces, measures 19.2 inches long, and has bright blue eyes. She was born alongside a twin brother, who is not leucistic and has normal coloring.</p><p>Both of the babies were given a clean bill of health from the park’s veterinarian.</p><p>“These are incredibly special animals in the reptile world, and we are being very careful with their safety and security,” McHugh said. “We plan to have them on display early next year so guests can see them, learn about them, and fall in love with them like we have.”</p><p>The park is asking for the public’s help in naming the two new baby gators. Some fun names have already been submitted, like Pearl and Emerald, Barbie and Ken, Elsa and Olaf, and Grits and Gumbo, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a>.</p><p>The park previously enlisted the public’s help to name another alligator, which was missing its top jaw. Voters eventually settled on the name “Jawlene” (a nod to the Dolly Parton song).</p><p>After reading about the rare leucistic baby alligator born in Florida, read about <a href=#>the alligator nicknamed “El Chompo” who was found guarding a stash of fentanyl and heroin</a>.
