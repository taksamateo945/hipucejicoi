He won the EuroLeague title in 2018 and was named the Final Four MVP the same year. At a tender age, Luka was making a mark not just in the Liga ACB but also in the EuroLeague, where he was consecutively named the MVP. His performances for Real Madrid made it clear that he was destined for bigger stages, and the NBA was the obvious next step.</p><p>When talking about collaborations, one can’t help but mention the synergies Luka creates with his fellow athletes. He’s built an incredible rapport with Kristaps Porziņģis, showcasing a dynamic European duo in the NBA. Additionally, Luka’s presence on the court has also seen remarkable plays with Tim Hardaway Jr., Maxi Kleber, <a href=#>Jalen Brunson</a>, and Dorian Finney-Smith. On an international scale, representing Slovenia, he’s worked cohesively with Zoran Dragić, Goran Dragić, Mike Tobey, and Klemen Prepelič.</p><p>Luka’s exceptional talent has earned him several distinct honors throughout his career. In his rookie NBA season (2018-19), he clinched the NBA Rookie of the Year award. His performance didn’t slow down, as he quickly established himself as a mainstay in the NBA All-Star games. By the age of 22, he had already been selected to two All-NBA First Teams. Internationally, his leadership steered Slovenia to a historic first place in the 2017 FIBA EuroBasket, and he played an instrumental role in leading his nation to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, marking Slovenia’s debut in Olympic basketball.</p><span class=single__post-summary__social__label>More Luka Dončić</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCpnaSoe6%2Bx02innqyjZLm2t8Bmm6imk56wbrzErapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
