With the Summer Games kicking off just weeks after that tournament ends, he said suiting up for both simply wasn't realistic.</p><p>Messi confirmed to <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN</a> he reached out to Javier Mascherano, Argentina's under-23 coach, to relay his decision.</p><p>"I talked to Mascherano and the truth is we both understood the situation," he said. "It's hard [to think about the Olympics right now] because we're in Copa América. It would be two, three straight months of not being with the club, and more than anything I'm not at an age to be in everything.</p><p>"I have to choose carefully, and it would be too much to play two straight tournaments. I've been very lucky to play in the Olympics, of winning it together with Masche. It was a wonderful experience on a football level. Olympics, U-20, memories I'll never forget."</p><p>The Olympics are different from most major international tournaments in that teams are required to select largely U-23 players. Up to three spots are allotted for players beyond the age cutoff, which opened a door for Messi.</p><p>Mascherano <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted</a> in February there were no guarantees when it came to his availability.</p><p>In addition to the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner's age, playing in MLS means he no longer has summers off.</p><p>Under the more traditional European calendar, he would've had around a monthlong break from competitive action before the Copa América kicked off. Instead, he suited up in Inter Miami's 1-1 draw with St. Louis City on June 1 and then put on an Argentina shirt in a 1-0 friendly win over Ecuador on June 9.</p><p>Messi has at least tasted Olympic gold before. Argentina beat Nigeria 1-0 in the 2008 final with a <a href=# rel=noopener>collection of talent</a> that probably hasn't been duplicated since.</p><p>Already having an Olympic medal in his trophy cabinet may have made it easier for the legendary forward to decline the opportunity for one last ride.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmDcoKMmqmgnZ6ptq%2Bt0majoqeemrluucSsqqJlp6S7tXnPpZiyZZmjerC42KanopujYruwwIyaq2aZnmKuqLGMraZmmpVitq95xK%2Bcq7Gknbavsw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
