In 2016, Freya made headlines for being “Britain’s loneliest dog” for spending her whole life in an animal shelter, from six weeks until she was six years old. While filming Transformers 5 in England, Bay read about her and decided to quickly cast her in the film. Thanks to the publicity, Freya found her forever home. The shelter also thanked Bay for the publicity they received which helped get other rescue dogs adopted.</p><h2 class=single__celeb-profile__title>Michael Bay</h2><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Michael-Bay-Pets-250x250.jpg alt="Michael Bay Pets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h4>Birthday</h4><p>February 17, 1965 (59)</p><p>Michael Bay is a Hollywood director, producer, and screenwriter who has created some of the most iconic films of the last two decades.
