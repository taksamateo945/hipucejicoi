He is the son of Ray Knoblauch (father) and Linda Knoblauch (mother).&nbsp; He grew up in a baseball family his father, and his uncle, Eddie, managed and played in the minor leagues.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>To get the attention of MLB scouts, he joined the Bellaire High School baseball team to become a professional. Later, he was selected in the 1986 MLB Draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, but instead of playing for them, he transferred to Texas A&M University in College Station to play baseball.</p><h2><span id=Chuck_Knoblauch_8211_Professional_Life>Chuck Knoblauch – Professional Life</span></h2><p>Chuck Knoblauch’s MLB career would have begun in 1986 if he had accepted a position with the Philadelphia Phillies. Nonetheless, his&nbsp;professional career began with the Minnesota Twins, who selected him in the first round of the 1989 MLB Draft.</p><p>As a result, his first season with the Twins was nothing less than outstanding. In his first season as a professional, he&nbsp;won the American League Rookie of the Year and the World Series.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-235332 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Chuck-Knoblauch-during-a-baseball-match.jpg alt="Chuck Knoblauch" width=650 height=486 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-235332 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Chuck Knoblauch during a baseball match (Source: Players Bio)</p><p>After that, he stayed with the Minnesota team for another six years. He attempted to take out three-time World Series champion Lonnie Smith in Game 7 of the World Series by appearing to start a double play on a Terry Pendleton hit. Chuck also stole over 40 bases in three consecutive seasons.</p><p>However, following the conclusion of the 1997 season, he requested to be traded because he believed he could not win another World Series with the Minnesota Twins. He was traded to the world-famous New York Yankees.</p><p>In this case, the deal benefited both the Minnesota Twins and Chuck because the Twins received two future All-Stars Eric Milton and Cristian Guzman. At the same time, he led the Yankees to three consecutive World Series victories in four years.</p><h4>Played other franchise clubs</h4><p>Furthermore, he scored the opening run in Game 3 of the 1999 World Series. Later in the game, he hit a two-run home run to tie the game in the eighth inning. As a result, the Yankees won both the game and the series.</p><p>Similarly, he was vital in the 2001 World Series, scoring the game-winning run in Game 5 to put the Yankees ahead 3-2 in the seven-game series. Unfortunately, the Yankees were defeated 4-3 in the World Series that year by the Arizona Diamondbacks, giving them a fourth consecutive World Series title.</p><p>He was then traded to the Kansas City Royals, where he played his final season of professional baseball.
