Kennedy Jr. in Massachusetts Ceremony</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Add her to the family tree! <strong>Cheryl Hines</strong> married<strong> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. </strong>at the Kennedy family compound on Cape Cod in Hyannis Port, Mass., on Saturday, Aug. 2, <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> can confirm. The couple said "I do" under a tent on the six-acre Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod.</p><p>The bride and groom were feted by 300 guests, including<strong> Larry David</strong>, <strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong>, <strong>Kevin Nealon</strong> and <strong>Ed Begley Jr</strong>. Hines, 48, wore a strapless Romona Keveza cocktail length dress and accessorized with a white belt. She wore her blonde locks up with loose strands pulled down around her face. She carried white roses and blue hydrangeas down the aisle, which matched the wedding's color scheme. RFK Jr. donned a black suit and black striped tie to exchange the couple's vows, which lasted 30 minutes.</p><p>Hines and Bobby Jr., the son of <strong>Ethel </strong>and <strong>Robert F. Kennedy </strong>and nephew of <strong>John F. Kennedy</strong>, got engaged this spring after two years of dating. News of their engagement was revealed at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in Phoenix, Ariz., on April 29.</p><p>The Curb Your Enthusiasm actress recently gushed to <strong>Us</strong> why she and the attorney are a perfect match. "We share the same values. Family first," she said at the Riverkeeper Fishermen's Ball in NYC in April. "We like to have a good time and work hard."</p><p>Hines noted that "it's fun to have a partner" while supporting each other's respective causes, but the pair also cherish their downtime together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"He's going to kill me if I tell you this," she told <strong>Us</strong> of Kennedy Jr., 60, at an UCLA environmental event in March. "The first time we went scuba diving together, he picked up a starfish at the bottom of the ocean, and gave it to me."</p><p>Scuba diving is just one of the ways the political scion has helped Hines become more adventurous. When the couple isn't having game nights they also ski and hike. Camping, however, is where Hines draws the line. "I feel like itâ€™s going to happen and I want to be ready," she laughed. "I don't want to do it."</p><p>This is the second marriage for the former Suburgatory star and the third for Kennedy Jr. Hines shares 10-year-old daughter <strong>Catherine</strong> with producer <strong>Paul Young</strong>, to whom she was married from 2002 to 2010. RFK Jr. shares son <strong>Bobby III</strong>, 29, and daughter <strong>Kathleen</strong>, 26, with first ex-wife <strong>Emily Ruth</strong>. He shared sons <strong>Conor</strong>, 19, <strong>Finn</strong>, 16,<strong> Aiden</strong>, 13, and daughter <strong>Kyra</strong>, 18, with the late <strong>Mary Kathleen Richardson</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhnaKuuW60yKecrGWdlr%2BztcSsZKunkpq%2FtXnFZqKepp6asbp5yatkoqZdoq60v8Ccn66rlanBtHnCnqmepZ%2Bjxm5%2Bj2pra3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
